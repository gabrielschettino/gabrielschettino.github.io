## About Me

I am an Electrical Engineering student at UFES, currently working as a PADTech developer where I have been using Spring Boot, Angular, MySQL, Docker, and Git for the past few months. 

Before that, I was a Fapes research fellow where I honed my skills in Python. I also completed an internship at Ufes where I configured and managed CMS (Drupal) for multiple institutional sites. 

In my free time, I volunteer as a production team member for ERUS, the Ufes Robotics Team.
